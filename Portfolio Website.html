              <p>This site is the newest web development I have undertaken.  I am very happy with how it is progressing.  
			  There will always be new things to add as I continue my craft and develop new projects.  If you have gotten 
			  as far as this page, then you have already seen my work and I hope you like it.</p> 
			  <p>When I first decided to build a web portfolio for myself I though, I need it to look great and really 
			  capture who I am as a person and of course impress the people who visit the site.  I had received good advice 
			  to make a site on squarespace, but I am currently trying to avoid expenditure of money until I get a job.  
			  I absolutely need to have something and luckily enough I still have access to my DeVry University webhosting 
			  for a few more months so I decided to build my own site.  Those drag and drop webpage builders make me sad 
			  anyhow, I like the coding too much to skip it.</p>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
          <div class="about-text">
              <p>I started by gathering up all the premade code that is available all over the internet.  People are really 
			  very helpful with little bits of code here and there.  My job is to put it all together into what I want.  
			  I studied a few portfolio websites that I liked and then set about to make my website.  The most custom part 
			  of my site so far is the Skills section.  I have seen many portfolios with percentages next to skills like 
			  html and C++, extrapolating what exactly those percentages mean is up for interpretation.   I decided to go 
			  with years of experience I have with the specific skill, that seemed clearer to me and hopefully to you as 
			  well.  The basic chart code was easy enough but arranging it to work across all devices was the most 
			  challenging.  Small screens mess things up sometimes.  I was able to fix it and that helped me fix a few 
			  issues with the menu on the main page as well because it would disappear on small screens, so I had to write 
			  some new code to run for small screens.</p>
			  <p>Overall, I am very happy with how my page is coming along and I hope you like it to.  If you don’t, you 
			  could fix it by pressing ALT + F4, that should fix it.  Unless you’re on a Mac, then I am sorry, and I believe 
			  you hit Command-W or even Command-Q.  That should cover everybody, but I forgot about phones, if you are on 
			  your phone you will just have to suffer though my page, you’re welcome.</p>
