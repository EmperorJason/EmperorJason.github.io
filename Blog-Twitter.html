		  <h2>Number 1 Spot</h2>
		  <h5>Finally the Top , October 1, 2019</h5>
			<h6>The Chase</h6>
			<p>It took a lot of time: increasing typing speed, learning the system inside and out, 
			recognizing area that could be improved. Now I am ranked number 1 in the company rankings 
			for level 1 IT associates.</p>
			<p>I attribute much of my success to the hot strings program I implemented.  I installed 
			a copy of Autohotkey and wrote a script that would fill in text like a text expander. 
			Autohotkeys calls it hot strings.  I type a few letters and boom, the script executes and 
			fills in a sentence.  This speeds up my ticket times greatly.  I hope to implement it company 
			wide for all to use in the near future.  The trick is getting the company to recognize its value.</p>

		  <h2>Working in IT</h2>
		  <h5>Got a call that turned into a job! , March 11, 2019</h5>
			<h6>Work Work!</h6>
			<p>Went from Game Master at Blizzard to work IT with the Home Depot. Contracts end but working 
			at Blizzard was one of the greatest jobs I have had. I hope to make if back there one day, but 
			for now onto new adventures.</p>
			<p>I went through a period as a Contractor with KForce before getting hired on with The Home 
			Depot permanently.  I hope to move up to a programming or scripting position soon so I can put 
			my College degree to work. </p>

		  <h2>Battle for Azeroth</h2>
		  <h5>For The Horde!, September 6, 2018</h5>
			<h6>Where my time goes</h6>
			<p>I would be working on my new side project of putting together a database for my wifes recipes… 
			BUT.  We are busy running around Azeroth killing every Alliance dog we see.  She is OK with 
			putting the project on hold, so we can get geared up and ready to raid with our guild on Hydraxis, 
			Stryke Force!</p>
			<p>The new Battle for Azeroth expansion has been awesome!  Great work Blizzard, and I don’t 
			say that just because I work there.  There is a whole island named after my character Tuskmasher.  
			Maybe it is a coincidence that there is a Tusk Isle and Blizzard did not in fact name a part 
			of the game for me, but I like to believe they do like me that much.  Thank you Blizzard I love 
			you too!</p>
			<h6>Back to my project</h6>
			<p>I will get back to work on it after the hype on BFA has died down a little and I have 
			caught up to the item levels of my guild mates.  It will be soon, I am sure…</p>

		  <h2>Project Selection</h2>
		  <h5>So Many Choices, July 30, 2018</h5>		  
		  <h6>Where to start?!?!?!</h6>
		  <p>I Recently started a new job where I get to be a Game Master for Blizzard Entertainment.  
		  It is very exciting and I cannot remember a time when I have had soooo much fun at a job.  
		  However, this job does affect my ability to develop a video game.  I am under a non-compete, 
		  that means no making games.  I am ok with that and I understand that a game company does not 
		  want their employees making games that may compete with their own someday.</p>
		  
		  <p>Now back to what I am going to do with my time if I cannot make a video game?  It is a 
		  tough one (I know, right?) I have been planning to start on my own project for some time now 
		  and was just waiting to graduate college.  Now life has tossed a few more speed bumps my way, 
		  but no matter, I will overcome!</p>
		  
		  <p>You might be asking yourself the same question that I am at this point. “If you can make a 
		  game Jason what are you going to do… besides play WoW?”.  The answer is not so bad, make a website 
		  or an application.  Its not a video game, but it will give me something useful to do.  So here it 
		  is, are you ready? *Drum roll*</p>		  
		  
		  <h6>Kristin’s Recipes!</h6>
		  
		  <p>My wife loves to cook, and she is great at it.  The problem is that she has recipes all over the 
		  place.  If she doesn’t have one memorized, then she is likely to just look up something online to save 
		  time and the effort of searching for that one recipe out of the who knows how many she has.  The plan 
		  is to make a website with a companion android app to allow her to organize her recipes and easily look 
		  them up.</p>
		  <p>The bonus is that this makes me look like a great husband. *Cheering*  I mean I am already, but 
		  some credit every now and then is great.</p>

		  <h2>First Blog</h2>
		  <h5>Portfolio is up and running, July 8, 2018</h5>		  
		  <h6>Yay its go time!!!</h6>
		  <p>I have my portfolio up and running.  I have been working on it for… let’s say a week and a half.  
		  I was given a bunch of good advice from Adam Estela whom I met on Linkedin, and he told me to keep a 
		  blog and twitter account of everything I am doing.  He says it makes it easy for potential employers 
		  to see what I am up too.  I was great advice so thank you Adam and here I go!</p>
		  <h6>Starting a new job and a new project!</h6>
		  <p>I am starting a job on Monday as a contracted game master for Blizzard.  I am super psyched about it, 
		  I am sure it will go great!  On top of that, now that my portfolio webpage is all but complete, I need to 
		  start on a game project.  I have a few ideas in my back pocket, I will let you all know as soon as I make 
		  a decision of what to start on.  It might even involve this guy.</p>
