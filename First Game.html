              <p>This is the first game I ever made.  It is called CandC combined and I will explain why a little later.  
			  I used C++ to code it and everything was done from scratch.  The UI is a simple console text interface.  
			  Nothing of note visually, but my aim was the code!  How to make it work and function the way I wanted.  
			  Most importantly was to handle invalid input, because my brother would most assuredly not follow directions 
			  and try to break it, thanks for making my coding better Nick.  I no longer can find the code for the game, 
			  but I did stash away the game exe file, so not all was lost.  Memories of the beginning of my game creation 
			  adventure.</p>

          <div class="about-text">
              <p>The first thing I had to do to create the game was to decide on what type of game it would be.  
			  That was easy, fantasy combat!  I started to code was the combat system, I would worry about character 
			  creation later, combat was the coolest!  I made the characters have three abilities and they were; 
			  swing sword, throw fireball, or heal.  The balance on the combat system in the first iteration was 
			  perfect, to the point of winning or losing was really a game of chance.  That was not much fun, because 
			  combat needs to have skill involved, some way to be better than your opponent.  I decided that actions 
			  needed to be influenced not only by random number generators but by character stats.</p>

          <div class="about-text">
              <p>The next version of the combat system needed to include character states.  I went about creating 
			  variables to hold the character information.  Keep in mind that I had yet to learn about object-oriented 
			  design, I had only just finished reading C++ without fear: Second edition by Brain Overland, so the whole 
			  game was contained in one cpp file and was coded in linear style.  I had variables to keep all the 
			  information and functions to execute all the actions.  Nice and simple, I overhauled the character abilities 
			  by adding the character stats to abilities, health and mana pools.  The Combat system now had some life too 
			  it.</p>

          <div class="about-text">
              <p>The next thing to do was to create the character creation UI.  It was a matter of giving the user 
			  a choice of race, the basic human, elf, orc, or troll selection worked nicely.  Each race was given a 
			  base set of attributes and then the user was given the choice to add a few points to any stats they 
			  wanted.  The system was a bit clunky, having to spell everything out, but that is text games and 
			  sometimes I miss it.  After that was done, I took the combat system and the character creation system 
			  and put them together in one file, hence the C and C combined name.</p>

              <p>That was not the end of my plans for the game.  I had plans to implement a map and movement, but 
			  then disaster struck.  Unhappy circumstances befell my PC and the code for the game was lost to me.  
			  At least I still have the exe squirreled away for days when I am feeling nostalgic.</p>
